    BioScripts is a python library providing bioinformatics scripts through a simple and consistent interface. It can be used on the command line or via a web service. Each script consists of a plugin running the algorithm and an html form managing its inputs.

Simple and straightforward, with the complexity hidden for end-users, it allows quick installation and access to multiple tools. End-users may ignore where and how the operations are launched: on a dedicated machine with adapted CPU and RAM.
